# CSE571 Winter 2026 - Homework 1

This homework combines probabilistic robotics concepts including particle filter localization and EKF SLAM.

## Structure

- `problem1_particle_filter/`: Particle filter-based localization
- `problem2_ekf_slam/`: Extended Kalman Filter SLAM
- `shared/`: Shared resources (URDF files, meshes)

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Problem 1: Particle Filter Localization

Navigate to `problem1_particle_filter/` and run:
```bash
python localization.py
```

## Problem 2: EKF SLAM

Navigate to `problem2_ekf_slam/` and run:
```bash
python localization.py
```
